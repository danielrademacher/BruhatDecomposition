# Concept:
#    This implementation follows the ideas of
#    "Straight-line programs with memory and matrix Bruhat decomposition"
#    by Alice Niemeyer, Tomasz Popiel & Cheryl Praeger.
#    In the following all references will mean this paper
#    and in case we differ from this paper (due to readability or bug-fixing)
#    this will also be remarked.
#
#    Let g \in SL(d,p^f)
#    Bruhat Decomposition computes g = u1 * w * u2, where
#         - u1,u2 are lower triangular matrices
#         - w is monomial matrix
#
#    In this algorithm we want to compute the Bruhat-Decomposition of g
#    and give g (respectively u1,w and u2) as word in the so called
#    "LGO standard generators" (Section 3.1).
#
#    1) While computing u1 (resp u2) with some kind of Gau√ü-Algorithm,
#    we express the matrices as product of so called transvections
#    - For 1 <= j < i <= d: t_{i,j}(\alpha) is the matrix T with
#        1-entries on diagonal, T_i,j = \alpha, 0 elsewhere
#    Each t_{i,j}(\alpha) can be computed from t_{2,1}(\alpha) via recursion,
#    where we have to distinguish the odd and even dimensons (p12 Lemma 4.2).
#    This again can be expressed as a product of t_{2,1}(omega^\ell)
#    (where omega is a primitive element and 0 <= ell < f).
#    The transvections as words in the standard generators are described in
#    (p12 Lemma 4.2).
#    This yields a decomposition of u1 and u2 in standard generators.
#
#    2) In a further step we will decompose the monomial Matrix w in
#    a signed permutation matrix p_sign and a diagonal Matrix diag.
#    ( How to associate p_sign with a product of generators is
#    further described in (PART I b) and (PART III) )
#
#    3) The last step is the decomposition of the diagonal Matrix in 2)
#    as word in the standard generators.
#
#    We won't do this matrix multiplications directly, but write them
#    in a list to evaluate in a StraightLineProgram. (Section 2)
#    Although described differently in the paper, we sometimes will allow
#    instructions to multiply more than two elements (eg during conjugating).
#    This doesn't affect the optimality of an slp much, but higly increases
#    the readability of our implementation.

# HighestSlotOfSLP()

# while others may increase the highest slot used by more than one.
# (After explicitly writing in a slot j>N, the SLP continues creating slots
#    j+1,j+2,.. if no slot is explicitly given.)

# MatToWreathProd() and WreathProdToMat()
#####

# In PermSLP we want to transform the monomial matrix w given by
# UnipotentDecomposition() into a diagonal matrix.
#    (The exact procedure is described in PermSLP)
# Since multiplying the LGO standard-generators s,v and x not only involves
# permutations but we also have to consider which non-zero entries are +1 and
# which -1, we want to associate this matrices with permutations on 2d points.
# (cf Wreath-Product)

# < s,v,x > -> Sym(2d), M -> Mwr where
# i^Mwr =  j  and (i+d)^Mwr= j+d if M_i,j = 1        and
# i^Mwr = j+d and (i+d)^Mwr=  j  if M_i,j = -1
# for 1<=i<=d

# Due to their relation to wreath-products, we will call denote the image
# of a matrix M \in < s,v,x > by Mwr

# Input: M: A monomial matrix with only +1 and -1 entries

# Output: perm: the permutation Mwr

DeclareGlobalFunction( "MatToWreathProd" );



# In fact the association above is an isomorphism and we can associate to each
# permutation we compute during PermSLP a unique monomial matrix whose non-zero
# entries are +1 or -1.

# M_i,j = 1  if i^Mwr =  j <= d        and
# M_i,j = -1 if i^Mwr = j+d

# Input:    perm: A permutation in Sym(2d) sth. {{i,i+d}}_1<=i<=d are blocks
#            dim: The dimension of the matrix we want perm send to

# PermSLP()
#####

# In this function we will transform a monomial matrix w \in SL(d,q) into
# a diagonal matrix diag. Using only the standard-generators s,v,x this
# will lead to a monomial matrix p_sign with only +-1 in non-zero entries
# and p_sign*diag = w (ie diag = p_sign^-1*w )
# Furthermore we will return list slp of instructions which will
# (when evaluated at the LGO standard-generators) yield diag.

# It is sufficient for diag to be diagonal, if the permutation associated
# with w (ie i^\pi_w = j if M_i,j not 0) is the inverse of the permutation
# associated to p_sign (again only to Sym(d) )

# In PermSLP we thus transform \pi_w to () using only { \pi_s, \pi_v, \pi_x }
# In order to know diag without computing all matrix multiplications,
# (we don't know the signs of p_sign), we compute a second permutation
# simultaneously (here using their identification with permutations in Sym(2d)
# and identifying { \pi_s, \pi_v, \pi_x } with {s,v,x} )

# Input:    stdgens:  The LGO standard-generators
#            mat:    A monomial matrix  (ie w)
#            slp:    An already existing list of instructions *optional
